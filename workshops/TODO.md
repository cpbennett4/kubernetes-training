* finish all the slides
* finish general scripts

Questions
* I have external-name off because of conflicts. This means LIS won't really function correctly
* I assume lis, trampoline, demo-server, instanceno, prometheus, etc will be on cluster
* until alex has a stable podpreset replacement I have a clever tweak that creates podpresets for them
* will have to update the scripts then for the proper label
