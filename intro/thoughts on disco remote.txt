Prop I:

Declare your ingress URL directly

http://ingress-arch-prod-sc.otenv.com/via-ingress/oauth

Application changes it consumption appropriately

Cons: 
- by itself doesn't solve disco consumer issue
- location transparency very poor
- no worse than current system, but still crappy


PropI':

Same but add disco static announcement to fd-external

Removes one con


Prop II:

Use CNAMES


http://oauth.otenv.com
---> http://oauth-prod-sc.otenv.com
---> frontdoor-external.otenv.com || lis

Pro:
- works both for outside (eg singularity, outside world) consumers  and inside consumers.
- More flexible - cname can be indirect record pointer, so location transparent
- we have a process and config system!

Con:
- Hard to track usage and kill off

Prop III

Service: <serviceName>
single pod

nginx:

-  ${K8S_SERVICE_NAME}, ${DISCO_SERVICE_TYPE}

Take a call 

/* => http(s)://ingress-arch-prod-sc.otenv.com/via-ingress/oauth

- Use a small nginx proxy helm chart  launched by the application service  team
- standardized format.
- Creates service in ot namespace so...
- have flag to indicate "announce to disco too" - covering disco.

Pros:
- pretty easy to update
-  Easy, standardized, transparent post.
- Internal DNS created correctly etc.
- reversal of roles - consumer is responsible!

Cons:
- Jenky extra stubs everywhere.
- Tricky to clean up, though  access  logs will help
-- TLS issue



PROTOCOL=https, PATH=/book/*,     HOST=(m|www|secure).opentable.*           passthru       booking-flow


---> PROTOCOL=https, PATH=/book/*,     HOST=(m|www|secure).opentable.*           redirect http://ingress-arch-prod-sc.otenv.com/via-ingress/oauth

option I, easy but a bit error  prone


---> PROTOCOL=https, PATH=/book/*,     HOST=(m|www|secure).opentable.*           k8s   cluster=arch-prod-sc, service=oauth
---> PROTOCOL=https, PATH=/book/*,     HOST=(m|www|secure).opentable.*           k8s   booking-flow



1. Service is happy and ready to stop announcing to disco
2. Service owner changes the PASSTHRU ==> k8s rule
3. Service stops announcing
